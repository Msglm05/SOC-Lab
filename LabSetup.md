# Lab Setup Overview 
### Active Directory Domain Controller
I will not go into detail about setting up AD as I have a project solely for that already
1. I installed Windows Server and configured Active Diretory Domain Services role in Server Manager. To do this you would click on Add roles and features, then select Active Diretory Domain Services and install.
2. After it has installed, you would click "Promote this server to a Domain Controller" and this is where you can configure a new forest and enter details such as your domain name.
3. After you have configured, you can then press install in which after your machine would reboot, you would then have a Domain Controller configured where you can create users, Organisational groups etc via Active Directory Users and Computers.
4. In this lab, I created 2 users and the one which was attacked was Terry Smith, with the username of tsmith <img width="188" height="43" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26f30cb6-158a-42c6-98af-7ea7f8ebb12e" />
