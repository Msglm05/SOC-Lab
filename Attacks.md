# Attacks 🎯
❗In this section, is important that all of the virtual machines involved in this lab to be up and running for connectivity between the systems such that the operations carry out successfully, such as the attack, the logs being forwarded to splunk, accessing splunk etc. 
Now that the attacking machiene is in the same network and is equipped with its attacking tool, the attack can take place. As disussed, in this example I used a tool called crowbar which is a brute force tool and I specifically targeted the Remote Desktop servive (RDP) that I made available in the target machine.
